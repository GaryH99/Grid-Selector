# Grid-Selector
Implements code to display images in a grid then highlights them once selected.

This is just a simple program to show an example of my work.  It is designed for a 320dp width phone in 
portrait orientation.  If other screen configurations are desired, alternate layout files could be added 
(layout-sw600dp, layout-land etc).
